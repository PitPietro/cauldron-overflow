/*
 * The only rule of a Symfony controller is that it must return a Symfony Response object.
 * That's nice because, at the end of the day, our only job as developers is to return a response to the user.
 * But ultimately, Symfony doesn't care if you render a template, generate some JSON or do something else in order to create the Response.
 * it's not an absolute rule that a controller must return a Response - there is a way around this. It's not important now (and maybe not ever), but it is possible!
